# Pull

## Pulling a project is taking/fetching code changes from the remote repo to your local repo (so that your repo is up to date)

### Can be seen as the following

```bash
(remote) main -> (local) main
```

### Can think about it as pushing from the remote to your local (it's not exactly this)
